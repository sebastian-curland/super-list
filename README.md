# super-list


This is a small node.js application to manage lists, I used this as a grocery shopping list but it can be used for any kind of "TODOo" lists.

**Features**
 - Add/Delete entries to the list. 
 - Mark an entry as "done". 
 - The list can be seen by others and any change on the list will be published to others in real-time (websocket).

How to run it:

 - Run *npm install* to download node.js modules.
 - Run the mongo DB.
 - Run *node server*
 - Open a browser and go to http://localhost:9000/
